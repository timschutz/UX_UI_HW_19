<!-- ***THE CHALLENGE*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <h5>The Federal Trade Commission is a sprawling organization whose principle mission is the enforcement of civil U.S. antitrust law and the promotion of consumer protection. Our challenge was to redesign their website to better organize information and create a smoother user experience.</h5>

<!-- ***PROTO PERSONA*** -->

  <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
  <h5>The proto-persona is a hypothetical user based on educated assumptions by the designers. This allows the creative team to start the design process without having to know every detail of our potential user.</h5>

<!-- ***BPS SETUP*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h5>A brand positioning statement outlines exactly what your company does, for whom, and what makes you different. The idea behind it is to create a unique niche for your brand in the minds of consumers within your category. We took what we knew of the Federal Trade Commission based on our research and created a brand positioning statement for our project.</h5>
</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>



<!-- ***RP SETUP*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h5>For our initial user testing we had a demographically diverse group of people run through a variety of tasks on the existing FTC site. Through this we were able to discover common pain points and challenges that the average user would encounter.</h5>

<!-- ***MOOD BOARD*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h3>Mood Board</h3>
  <h5>Our goal was to visually communicate a sense of strength and confidence in the agency, while creating a clear and logical layout that would enable users to access protections and information.</h5>

</div>



<!-- ***SM SETUP TEXT*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h5>We found the card sorting exercise challenging. The Federal Trade Commision is such a broad organization, that breaking down the homepage to its links created many (seemingly) random names and programs. In the end, we found a way to re-contextualize the information in a way that allows users to more easily navigate to their desired destination.</h5>
</div>



<!-- ***SITE MAP*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h3>Site Map</h3>
  <h5>Pulling the data from card sorting, we plugged it into a sitemap. This process revealed additional cards that could be purged or combined to further streamline our navigation bar. Once complete, we were ready to work on a mockup using the sitemap to guide us.</h5>

<!-- ***MID FIDELITY*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h3>Mid Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
  <h5>When designing our mobile interface, we wanted to avoid information overload, especially hard given the content of the website. To achieve this, we went with a dropdown-style menu that would allow the user to incrementally access more information as they made progress, but also give them an easy way to take a step back if they realized they weren’t going down the right path. We took a similar approach to the desktop interface, which also utilized our reorganization of categories to give the user a clearer starting point.</h5>

<!-- ***UI STYLE GUIDE*** -->



<div class="text_title">
  <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
  <h5>Once we started building out our high fidelity prototype, we made a few changes to the style guide. This was primarily done to increase overall usability while still resulting in a consistent look across pages.</h5>

<!-- ***FINAL THOUGHTS*** -->



<div class="text_title last">
  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <h5>By the end of this project we felt we had successfully used our existing design skills in conjunction with our new UX/UI design knowledge to analyze and improve the navigation on the FTC website. From the initial testing we found many aspects to improve upon, and during the redesign process we also discovered areas for additional improvement.</h5>
  <h5>A challenge we overcame in the redesign process was taking the very broad and expansive FTC website and presenting it in a way that was more palatable and less overwhelming. In the final stages, we were happily surprised by our testing, with near 100% success on our testing tasks. Overall we feel we learned a lot during this project and accomplished our goal of creating a more user friendly FTC website.</h5>
